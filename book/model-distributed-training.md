# Model-Distributed Training

This page is placeholder for the model-distributed training chapter, which still needs to be written!

**TLDR**: model-distributed training is the next step up data-distributed training, and should almost always be used in tangent with that technique. However it comes with massive complexity cost, and is therefore only used for the largest, most complex, and most important models.
